Alembic is used in conjunction with SQLAlchemy to manage state of database migrations for the content_store database
https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html

Migrations are usually managed via the `content_store/content_store_manager.py` script

In normal usage scripts are called by the the 'conductor' container to do inititial setup (database and user creation) and automatically apply migrations. 

Most tests will need to destroy and setup the database before running. 

- `docker compose run conductor content_store setup` will initialize the database and setup appropriate users (run automatically if needed on container initialization) and try to run migrations
- `docker compose run conductor content_store migrate` will apply the most recent migration
- `docker compose run conductor content_store destroy` will DELETE ALL DATA and tear down the database 

From inside the docker container, these can be run as:
- `python3 -m timpani.content_store.content_store_manager setup`

 New migration templates can be created norml alembic commands from inside the conductor container:
`docker compose exec conductor bash`
`python3 -m alembic -c timpani/content_store/alembic.ini revision --autogenerate  -m 'create initial table definitions'`


This is a Generic single-database configuration.
